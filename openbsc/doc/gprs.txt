Ethernet


Identities:
IMSI		SIM identity
P-TMSI		allocated to each GPRS-attached MS
TLLI		unambiguously identifies the logical link
NSAPI		identifies PDP context associated with PDP address
		MS selects unused NSAPI while PDP ctx activation
NSAPI+TLLI	NSAPI+TLLI pair is unique within RA


TLLI address ranges
local		derived from the P-TMSI allocated by the SGSN, valid only in one RA
foreign		derived from the P-TMSI allocated in another RA
random		used when MS has no P-TMSI availaible
auxiliary	selected by SGSN used for anonymous access MM+PDP ctx
