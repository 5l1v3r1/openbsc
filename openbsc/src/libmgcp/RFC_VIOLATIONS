The MGCP implementation is not complete and has various bugs:


- CallID/ConnID is only verified if present but things work
  when they are left out.
- DLCX without ConnID should delete all connections on the
  endpoint.
- AUEP should report more details of the endpoint, e.g. if it
  is available or in use right now.
